:summary: Remote work tips and tools

Some tools I find very useful when working remotely (everthing is free unless explicitely stated):

* RescueTime: allows you to track your time and start FocusTime sessions to block all kind of distractions (FocusTime comes with the premium vesion, for $9/month):: `<https://www.rescuetime.com/>`_
* Don't touch ya face: if you have habits you want to get rid of, or be safe in times of pandemic, try donttouchyaface, it's free and privacy preserving: `<https://www.donttouchyaface.com/>`_
* Anti-RSI: reminds you to look away from the screen every now and then, and to take breaks ($4.99): `<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/antirsi/id442007571?mt=12>`_
* Grokker: well being and sport at home: `<https://www.grokker.com/>`_
* ScratchWork: the best shared dashboard I've found so far: `<https://app.scratchwork.io/>`_

Some habits that are even more valuable when being remote:

* Meditation: I highly recommend Sam Harriss' app: Waking Up ($15/month, but you can get it for free if you don't have much money and send a nice email). 
* Sport: at least once every other day. It doesn't have to be intense, but you'll need this endorphins shoot.
* Gratitude journal: social interaction is of paramount importance when working remotely. A great way to enhance it is to write daily in a gratitude journal.
